```

## Stow Installation

To apply the Claude Code configuration:

```bash
# Apply Claude Code configuration (agents, settings.json, and global CLAUDE.md)
stow .claude

# This creates:
# ~/.claude/agents/                   # Custom agent configurations
# ~/.claude/settings.json             # Global Claude Code settings
# ~/.config/claude/CLAUDE.md          # System-wide best practices reference
```

**Important:** Runtime files (local/, projects/, shell-snapshots/, statsig/, todos/, mcp.json, settings.local.json) remain in ~/.claude and are NOT managed by stow.

- **dependency-management-security**: Vulnerability scanning, automated updates, breaking change detection, and supply chain security

Skills are model-invoked (Claude decides when to use them based on context) and package expertise into discoverable capabilities.

### Understanding Skills vs Agents

**Agents** are specialized AI personas invoked explicitly by the user or Claude Code for complex multi-step tasks:
- User or system explicitly launches agents with the Task tool
- Examples: `devops-infrastructure-specialist`, `frontend-ui-ux-specialist`
- Long-running autonomous operations
- Can use all available tools

**Skills** are model-invoked capabilities that Claude automatically uses when relevant:
- Claude autonomously decides to use skills based on the task context
- Examples: TDD workflow triggers when writing tests, security audit triggers when reviewing security
- Focused on specific workflows or checklists
- Can restrict tool usage with `allowed-tools` field
- Lighter-weight than agents, perfect for patterns and workflows

**When to Use Each:**
- Use **agents** for complex, multi-step projects requiring planning and execution (e.g., "design and implement a microservices architecture")
- Use **skills** for recurring workflows, checklists, and best practices (e.g., TDD cycle, security audits, production readiness checks)

### Runtime Configuration Files (Not Stowable)

These files contain user-specific data and runtime state, managed directly in ~/.claude:

#### `~/.claude/settings.local.json`
Claude Code permissions and tool access configuration:
- **Bash permissions**: Specific command access patterns
- **Tool integrations**: Git, GPG, Homebrew, development tools
- **Security controls**: Allow/deny patterns for command execution

#### `~/.claude/mcp.json`
Model Context Protocol configuration:
- **MCP server connections**: GitHub, Playwright, Ref documentation access
- **Resource access**: Repository management, browser automation, documentation search
- **Integration settings**: Tool-specific configurations and permissions

### Data and History (Runtime Only)

#### `~/.claude/projects/`
Project-specific conversation history and context:
- **Conversation logs**: Per-project interaction history with Claude
- **Context preservation**: Maintains project-specific knowledge between sessions
- **Development continuity**: Enables Claude to understand ongoing project work

#### `~/.claude/todos/`
Task management and todo tracking:
- **Session todos**: Task lists from Claude Code sessions
- **Progress tracking**: Completion status and task history
- **Archive**: Historical task data for reference

#### `~/.claude/shell-snapshots/`
Shell environment snapshots for context:
- **Environment capture**: Shell state and variable snapshots
- **Context restoration**: Ability to understand shell session context
- **Debugging assistance**: Historical shell state for troubleshooting

#### `~/.claude/statsig/`
Usage analytics and feature flags:
- **Usage metrics**: Claude Code usage patterns and statistics
- **Feature flags**: Beta feature enablement and configuration
- **Performance data**: Session performance and optimization metrics

#### `~/.claude/local/`
Local Claude Code installation and dependencies:
- **Binary files**: Claude Code executable and runtime dependencies
- **Node modules**: Required JavaScript packages and libraries
- **Installation assets**: Supporting files for Claude Code operation

## Purpose

The `.claude` directory serves as the centralized location for:

- **Shared Configuration**: Agents and best practices that can be version controlled
- **Runtime Data**: Project history, todos, and user-specific settings that are machine-local
- **Development Assistance**: Context and configurations for Claude-assisted development

## Integration with Dotfiles

This Claude Code configuration is designed to work seamlessly with the modular dotfiles architecture:

- **Stow Compatibility**: Only agents and global CLAUDE.md are managed with GNU Stow
- **Documentation Consistency**: Follows the same documentation patterns as other modules
- **Security Awareness**: Respects the repository's security practices and GPG signing
- **Runtime Separation**: Keeps user data and runtime files separate from version control

## Features

### Context Awareness
Claude Code is configured to understand:
- The modular architecture of this dotfiles repository
- Each tool's specific configuration patterns
- Security requirements for GPG and SSH key management
- Stow-based symlink management system

### Tool Integration
Works with all configured tools:
- **Terminal Environment**: Zsh, Oh-My-Zsh, Starship configurations
- **Code Editor**: Neovim with LSP and debugging setup
- **Version Control**: Git with GPG signing and LazyGit interface
- **Container Development**: Docker configurations and templates
- **Session Management**: Tmux multiplexer setup
- **Security Tools**: GPG and SSH key management

### Development Assistance
- **Configuration Management**: Help with stow operations and symlink management
- **Security Guidance**: Assist with GPG key generation and SSH configuration
- **Tool Setup**: Guide through complex tool installations and configurations
- **Troubleshooting**: Debug configuration issues across all modules

## Best Practices

### When Working with Claude Code

1. **Respect Existing Patterns**: Follow the established configuration patterns in each module
2. **Security First**: Never compromise GPG or SSH key security when making changes
3. **Test Changes**: Always test configuration changes in a safe environment
4. **Document Updates**: Update relevant CLAUDE.md files when making significant changes
5. **Backup Important Data**: Ensure GPG and SSH keys are backed up before major changes

### Configuration Changes

- **Use Stow for Shared Config**: Apply agent and global CLAUDE.md changes through stow
- **Direct Edit for Runtime**: Modify runtime files directly in ~/.claude
- **Preserve Local Settings**: Respect machine-specific configurations
- **Follow Theme System**: Maintain Catppuccin theming consistency across tools
- **Version Control**: Commit shareable configuration changes with descriptive messages

## Usage Examples

### Common Tasks
```bash
# Apply Claude Code shared configuration (agents + global CLAUDE.md)
stow .claude

# View current agents
ls ~/.claude/agents/

# View installed skills
ls ~/.claude/skills/

# Edit a skill
nvim ~/.claude/skills/tdd-workflow/SKILL.md

# Create a new skill
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/my-new-skill
nvim ~/.claude/skills/my-new-skill/SKILL.md

# Edit runtime settings directly
nvim ~/.claude/settings.local.json

# Remove shared configuration
stow -D .claude
```
