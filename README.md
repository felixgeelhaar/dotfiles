# DOTFILE Configuration

Welcome everyone! This is my personal dotfile repository.
Usually I use these days wezterm + starship and mostly work on golang, nodejs / javascript / typescript / bun, rust, and lua.

## How To

I used the dotfiles in combination with `stow`.
This enables to manage the dotfiles in a repo and enable these configurations via symlinks.

Navigation to your dotfiles directory and run:

```bash
    stow nvim
```
